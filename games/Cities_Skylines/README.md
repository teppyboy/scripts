# Scripts for [Cities: Skylines](https://www.citiesskylines.com/)
Scripts I created for this game, thats it.

### Scripts
+ [NotParadoxLauncher_Win_Proton.sh](./NotParadoxLauncher_Win_Proton.sh) - Install [Not Paradox Launcher] to Cities: Skylines (Windows version running in Linux using Proton)
+ [Win_Proton_dowser_patch.sh](./Win_Proton_dowser_patch.sh) - Replace dowser.exe with Cities.exe so the game can launch without using bloated launcher (for CS Windows version running in Proton)

#### Note
These script I created for my friend because I don't play this game, so if it has any problem then feel free to open a issue, thanks.
